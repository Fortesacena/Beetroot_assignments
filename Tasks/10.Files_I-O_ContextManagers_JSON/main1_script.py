#---------------------------TASK 1-----------------------------
"""
Write a script that creates a new output file called myfile.txt and 
writes the string "Hello file world!" in it. Then write another script 
that opens myfile.txt, and reads and prints its contents. Run your two 
scripts from the system command line. 

Does the new file show up in the directory where you ran your scripts? 

What if you add a different directory path to the filename passed to open?
